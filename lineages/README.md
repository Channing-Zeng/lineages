## Summary of lineages 



This report gives summaries of globally circulating lineages as of 2020-04-17. 
9875 sequences have been included in this analysis.
52 lineages have been assigned in this dataset.

Sequences which were replicates or too error-prone were removed from this analysis.



7 are pending extinction ie last seen three weeks ago.
2 have not been seen for more than one month, and so are viewed as extinct, but will continue to be monitored.
37 lineages have gone quiet, ie haven't been seen this week.
1 has reactivated.
5 lineages have been continuously circulating.


Note that the status of a lineage is highly likely to be due to heterogeneity in sampling, and not necessarily indicative of real decline of lineages.

The table below shows summary information of each lineage. 

The "most common countries" column shows the three countries with the most sequences from each lineage, and the percentages by the country represent the percentage of sequences in that lineage taken from that location.

Again, please interpret this with caution. Some countries are sequencing much more than others, and so locations of lineages may be at least partially due to this. It does not imply direction of transmission from one country to another. 
Sometimes we have been able to examine lineages which we know are circulating in one country by looking at sequences from another country due to associated epidemiological information.
