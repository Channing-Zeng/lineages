This is a companion repository to the paper describing a dynamic lineage nomenclature system for SARS-CoV-2.

## Summary of lineages 



This report gives summaries of globally circulating lineages as of 2020-04-23. 
15194 sequences have been included in this analysis.
81 lineages have been assigned in this dataset.

Sequences which were replicates or too error-prone were removed from this analysis.



14 are pending extinction ie last seen three weeks ago.
6 have not been seen for more than one month, and so are viewed as extinct, but will continue to be monitored.
40 lineages have gone quiet, ie haven't been seen this week.
3 lineages have reactivated.
18 lineages have been continuously circulating.


Note that the status of a lineage is highly likely to be due to heterogeneity in sampling, and not necessarily indicative of real decline of lineages.

The table below shows summary information of each lineage. 

The "most common countries" column shows the three countries with the most sequences from each lineage, and the percentages by the country represent the percentage of sequences in that lineage taken from that location.

Again, please interpret this with caution. Some countries are sequencing much more than others, and so locations of lineages may be at least partially due to this. It does not imply direction of transmission from one country to another. 
Sometimes we have been able to examine lineages which we know are circulating in one country by looking at sequences from another country due to associated epidemiological information.

A couple of key bits of information about specific lineages that are not necessarily reflected by numbers and locations of sequences:

 - B.1 is a lineage that began in Italy, and has since seeded many different countries
 - B.4 is a lineage from Iran, but we do not have many sequences - we know this because many of our sequences are from travellers from Iran, so we have sampled them in the countries they arrived in.
